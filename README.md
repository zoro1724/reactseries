 1-here we learn how actual react flow work
 2-The main difference b/w the (createreact) nd (vite method) is that (react Script ) as in acse of (createreact) its package.json have it while (vite)it doesn't have it
 3-so in case of (index.js)in case of (createreact) we don't need to define script tag there while (vite) it must mention
 4-rest of comment on vite.
 5-while creating own function Keep it name first letter CAPITAL.
